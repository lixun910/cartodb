## Support Options

*CartoDB.js v3.15* is **no longer being actively developed**. Major bugs will be addressed as needed.

You can check out the new release of *CARTO.js v4* in the [documentation](https://carto.com/developers/carto-js/) and its [support options](https://carto.com/developers/carto-js/support/support-options/).

However, if you feel stuck, there are many ways to find help.

* Ask a question on [GIS StackExchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/carto) using the `CARTO` tag.
* [Report an issue](https://github.com/CartoDB/carto.js/issues) in Github.
* Enterprise Plan customers have additional access to enterprise-level support through CARTO's support representatives.
